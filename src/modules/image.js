/**
@module   image.js
@desc     Image loader and helper
@category public

Loads an image and draws it on a canvas.
The returned object is a canvas wrapper and its methods (get, sample, etc.)
can be used before the image has completely loaded.

Usage:
// Starts async loading:
const img = Image.load('res/pattern.png')
// Returns a black color until the image has been loaded:
const color = img.get(10, 10)
